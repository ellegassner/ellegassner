# Hi friends! I'm Elle 🐳

## Front-End Web Developer with experience as an entrepreneur, designer, and photographer. I'm excited about creating dry, responsive, and accessible code. 

With my past experiences, I have developed skills as a self-starter, the ability to solve complex problems, and adapt to changing environments.

+ 🚧 Check out my portfolio at https://www.ellegassner.com/ (currently under construction!) 

+ 🏫 Continuously working to build my skills in HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript/jQuery, and React.

+ 🛒 As a passion-project, I have curated an online shop for home decor, featuring products made only by makers and artists (over 40 of them!) in BC, Canada.

+ 🪴 I’m a self-classified "Renaissance Woman", which means I like to do a little bit of everything.. including woodworking and silversmithing.
